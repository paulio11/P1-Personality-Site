## Introduction
This website servs as a first point of contact and information for YouTuber and Twitch stream Kyle Bosman.

A problem with the modern internet is that there are so many services one idividual may be signed up for and using at the same time - all for different purposes and reasons. Sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Patreon, YouTube and Twitch. When you google someone you get hundreds of results all taking you to different places where you may or may not find the information you are looking for.

The goal of this project is was to make a central location where you can find exacatly what you've been looking for. A short summary about the person and showcases of the work they do and links to follow to all corners of the internet where they might have public profiles/pages. Enabling you to get to where you need to be.

Since googling my own name hopefully should bring up zero results I have taken on the identity of a lesser known internet celebrity to serve as my example. In particular - YouTuber and Twitch streamer Kyle Bosman. You can find more information about him in the website I have put together for this project. There you will see an overview of the things he does and where you can find that work. From his YouTube series [Delayed Input](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXjlB8AgMh8QuT0_ao9vaZlI1jf2U4SGS) to his streaming schedule on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kylebosman), as well as a little history of what he has been up to recently.

The site was not made as a fan site, but more as If I were the person himself and required someplace to be my own corner of the internet.

**This is in no way associated with Kyle and all the videos linked to and embeded on the website belong to him.**

This was my first milestone project required to complete my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [The Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net). This website required me to showcase my newly learned HTML and CSS skills by creating something that was both useful to the end user and responsive in design so it could scale to any resonable display size.

## The User Experience
A user for this website could fall into one of the following categories:
- A fan of Kyle.
- A new future business partner.
- A new potential fan.

### User Goals

#### As a fan

## Development Planning

To meet the requirements of the potential users the website will have to have the following sections/pages:
